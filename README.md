## diamo12's Personal Website

<p>This is a website I am self-hosting to house various web apps I've made over the years, as well as any new ones I make. This project is just for fun, I'm learning new things as I develop this further. I also might put silly things out there for my friends or DougDoug to see.</p>

## Setup

<p>This app uses the <a href="https://rivet.iu.edu">Rivet Design Framework</a> for the front-end design. For the back-end, this app uses the Laravel framework and runs on a LAMP web stack. The server is actually just my old gaming PC that I installed Ubuntu on and set up LAMP on lol. Also, not putting my .env out there for obvious reasons, but if you use the example laravel gives you, you can make this work with some simple (if you know what you're doing) modifications. Other than that, I'm using everything as it comes out of the box, no extra add-ons or plugins needed. Domain name (diamo12.net) is bought and managed through Cloudflare.</p>
